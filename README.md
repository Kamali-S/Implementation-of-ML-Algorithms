# My-Projects
I have implemented basic Machine Learning algorithms such as Single-layer Perceptron, Multi-layer Perceptron, Logistic Regression,
Multi-way classification using Iris-dataset, Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbour, ROC-curve, AUC, Decision Tree using Play_Tennis dataset and
Transport dataset. Also implemented Mathematical Modelling concepts such as Seasonal-index, Spline-Interpolation.
